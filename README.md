# What is a filesystem?

## 
To host locally do:
```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The url at which the project is being served will be printed.
It will probably be [http://127.0.0.1:4000/what_is_a_filesystem/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/what_is_a_filesystem/).

To run tests, install `jasmine` and run `jasmine server`.
