Welcome to `What is a filesystem?`
This website is intended to serve as a learning tool for students who're either taking [CS241 @ UIUC](http://cs241.cs.illinois.edu), or an equivalent course at another university.
The content consists of a series of "chapters" that have some component of a visulazation or an interactive simulator that helps reinforce the concepts presented.

To see other projects/visualizations I've worked on, check out my website [aneeshdurg.me](http://aneeshdurg.me).
