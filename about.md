Welcome to `What is a filesystem?`
This website is intended to serve as a learning tool for students who're either taking [CS241 @ UIUC](http://cs241.cs.illinois.edu), or an equivalent course at another university.
The content consists of a series of "chapters" that have some component of a visulazation or an interactive simulator that helps reinforce the concepts presented.

If you'd like to give me feedback about this website, please check out [this feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdj6T2PV_6az8Vx1Lkt9hbk17IKbAls-7O4ZV70e-GT-xmJEQ/viewform?usp=sf_link).

To see other projects/visualizations I've worked on, check out my website [aneeshdurg.me](http://aneeshdurg.me).
